title: Robust Cost Sensitive Support Vector Machine
abstract: In this paper we consider robust classifications and show equivalence between
  the regularized classifications. In general, robust classifications are used to
  create a classifier robust to data by taking into account the uncertainty of the
  data. Our result shows that regularized classifications inherit robustness and provide
  reason on why some regularized classifications tend to be robust against data. Although
  most robust classification problems assume that every uncertain data lie within
  an identical bounded set, this paper considers a generalized model where the sizes
  of the bounded sets are different for each data. These models can be transformed
  into regularized classification models where the penalties for each data are assigned
  according to their losses. We see that considering such models opens up for new
  applications. For an example, we show that this robust classification technique
  can be used for Imbalanced Data Learning. We conducted experimentation with actual
  data and compared it with other IDL algorithms such as Cost Sensitive SVMs. This
  is a novel usage for the robust classification scheme and encourages it to be a
  suitable candidate for imbalanced data learning.
