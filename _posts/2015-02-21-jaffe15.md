title: "{Estimating the accuracies of multiple classifiers without labeled data}"
abstract: 'In various situations one is given only the predictions of multiple classifiers
  over a large unlabeled test data. This scenario raises the following questions:
  Without any labeled data and without any a-priori knowledge about the reliability
  of these different classifiers, is it possible to consistently and computationally
  efficiently estimate their accuracies? Furthermore, also in a completely unsupervised
  manner, can one construct a more accurate unsupervised ensemble classifier? In this
  paper, focusing on the binary case, we present simple, computationally efficient
  algorithms to solve these questions.   Furthermore, under standard classifier independence
  assumptions, we prove our methods are consistent and study their asymptotic error.
  Our approach is spectral, based on the fact that the off-diagonal entries of the
  classifiersâ€™ covariance matrix and 3-d tensor are rank-one. We illustrate the competitive
  performance of our algorithms via extensive experiments on both artificial and real
  datasets.'
