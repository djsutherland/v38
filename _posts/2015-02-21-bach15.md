title: "{Unifying Local Consistency and MAX SAT Relaxations for Scalable Inference
  with Rounding Guarantees}"
abstract: 'We prove the equivalence of first-order local consistency relaxations and
  the MAX SAT relaxation of Goemans and Williamson (1994) for a class of MRFs we refer
  to as logical MRFs. This allows us to combine the advantages of each into a single
  MAP inference technique: solving the local consistency relaxation with any of a
  number of highly scalable message-passing algorithms, and then obtaining a high-quality
  discrete solution via a guaranteed rounding procedure when the relaxation is not
  tight. Logical MRFs are a general class of models that can incorporate many common
  dependencies, such as logical implications and mixtures of supermodular and submodular
  potentials. They can be used for many structured prediction tasks, including natural
  language processing, computer vision, and computational social science. We show
  that our new inference technique can improve solution quality by as much as 20%
  without sacrificing speed on problems with over one million dependencies.'
