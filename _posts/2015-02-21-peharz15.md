title: On Theoretical Properties of Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a promising avenue for probabilistic modeling
  and have been successfully applied to various tasks. However, some theoretic properties
  about SPNs are not yet well understood. In this paper we fill some gaps in the theoretic
  foundation of SPNs. First, we show that the weights of any complete and consistent
  SPN can be transformed into locally normalized weights without changing the SPN
  distribution. Second, we show that consistent SPNs cannot model distributions significantly
  (exponentially) more compactly than decomposable SPNs. As a third contribution,
  we extend the inference mechanisms known for SPNs with finite states to generalized
  SPNs with arbitrary input distributions.
