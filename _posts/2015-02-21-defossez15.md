title: 'Averaged Least-Mean-Squares: Bias-Variance Trade-offs and Optimal Sampling
  Distributions'
abstract: 'We consider the least-squares regression problem and provide a detailed
  asymptotic analysis of the performance of averaged constant-step-size stochastic
  gradient descent. In the strongly-convex case, we provide an asymptotic expansion
  up to explicit exponentially decaying terms. Our analysis leads to new insights
  into stochastic approximation algorithms: (a) it gives a tighter bound on the allowed
  step-size; (b) the generalization error may be divided into a variance term which
  is decaying as O(1/n), independently of the step-size g, and a bias term that decays
  as O(1/g^2 n^2); (c) when allowing non-uniform sampling of examples over a dataset,
  the choice of a good sampling density depends on the trade-off between bias and
  variance: when the variance term dominates, optimal sampling densities do not lead
  to much gain, while when the bias term dominates, we can choose larger step-sizes
  that lead  to significant improvements.'
