title: "{A Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Spherical Data}"
abstract: Directional data, naturally represented as points on the unit sphere, appear
  in many applications.  However, unlike the case of Euclidean data, flexible mixture
  models on the sphere that can capture correlations, handle an unknown number of
  components and extend readily to high-dimensional data have yet to be suggested.  For
  this purpose we propose a Dirichlet process mixture model of Gaussian distributions
  in distinct tangent spaces (DP-TGMM) to the sphere.  Importantly, the formulation
  of the proposed model allows the extension of recent advances in efficient inference
  for Bayesian nonparametric models to the spherical domain.  Experiments on synthetic
  data as well as real-world 3D surface normal and 20-dimensional semantic word vector
  data confirm the expressiveness and applicability of the DP-TGMM.
