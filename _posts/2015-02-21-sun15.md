title: Inferring Block Structure of Graphical Models in Exponential Families
abstract: Learning the structure of a graphical model is a fundamental problem and
  it is used extensively to infer the relationship between random variables. In many
  real world applications, we usually have some prior knowledge about the underlying
  graph structure, such as degree distribution and block structure. In this paper,
  we propose a novel generative model for describing the block structure in general
  exponential families, and optimize it by an Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm
  with variational Bayes. Experimental results show that our method performs well
  on both synthetic and real data. Further, our method can predict overlapped block
  structure of a graphical model in general exponential families.
