title: Preferential Attachment in Graphs with Affinities
abstract: Preferential attachment models for random graphs are successful in capturing
  many characteristics of real networks such as power law behavior. At the same time
  they lack flexibility to take vertex to vertex affinities into account, a feature
  that is commonly used in many link recommendation algorithms.   We propose a random
  graph model based on both node attributes and preferential attachment. This approach
  overcomes the limitation of existing models on expressing vertex affinity and on
  reflecting properties of different subgraphs. We analytically prove that our model
  preserves the power law behavior in the degree distribution as expressed by natural
  graphs and we show that it satisfies the small world property. Experiments show
  that our model provides an excellent fit of many natural graph statistics and we
  provide an algorithm to infer the associated affinity function efficiently.
