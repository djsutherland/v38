title: Minimizing Nonconvex Non-Separable Functions
abstract: 'Regularization has played a key role in deriving sensible estimators in
  high dimensional statistical inference. A substantial amount of recent works has
  argued for nonconvex regularizers in favor of their superior theoretical properties
  and excellent practical performances. In a different but analogous vein, nonconvex
  loss functions are promoted because of their robustness against "outliers". However,
  these nonconvex formulations are computationally more challenging, especially in
  the presence of nonsmoothness and non-separability. To address this issue, we propose
  a new proximal gradient meta-algorithm by rigorously extending the proximal average
  to the nonconvex setting. We formally prove its nice convergence properties, and
  illustrate its effectiveness on two applications: multi-task graph-guided fused
  lasso and robust support vector machines. Experiments demonstrate that our method
  compares favorably against other alternatives.'
