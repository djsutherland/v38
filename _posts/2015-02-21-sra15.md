title: Data modeling with the elliptical gamma distribution
abstract: 'We study mixture modeling using the elliptical gamma (EG) distribution,
  a non-Gaussian distribution that allows heavy and light tail and peak behaviors.
  We first consider maximum likelihood parameter estimation, a task that turns out
  to be very challenging: we must handle positive definiteness constraints, and  more
  crucially, we must handle possibly nonconcave log-likelihoods, which makes maximization
  hard. We overcome these difficulties by developing algorithms based on fixed-point
  theory; our methods respect the psd constraint, while also efficiently solving the
  (possibly) nonconcave maximization to global optimality. Subsequently, we focus
  on mixture modeling using EG distributions: we present a closed-form expression
  of the KL-divergence between two EG distributions, which we then combine with our
  ML estimation methods to obtain an efficient split-and-merge expectation maximization
  algorithm. We illustrate the use of our model and algorithms on a dataset of natural
  image patches.'
