title: Parameter Estimation of Generalized Linear Models without Assuming their Link
  Function
abstract: Canonical generalized linear models (GLM) are completely specified by a
  finite dimensional vector and a monotonically increasing function called the link
  function. Standard parameter estimation techniques hold the link function fixed
  and optimizes over the parameter vector. We propose a parameter-recovery facilitating,
  jointly-convex, regularized loss functional that is optimized globally over the
  vector as well as the link function, with best rates possible under a first order
  oracle model. This widens the scope of GLMs to cases where the link function is
  unknown.
