title: "{Learning Efficient Anomaly Detectors from K-NN Graphs}"
abstract: We propose a non-parametric anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional
  data. We score each datapoint by its average K-NN distance, and rank them  accordingly.
  We then train limited complexity models to imitate these scores based on the max-margin
  learning-to-rank framework. A test-point is declared as an anomaly at α-false  alarm
  level if the predicted score is in the α-percentile. The resulting anomaly detector
  is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that for any false alarm rate α, its decision
  region converges to the α-percentile minimum volume level set of the unknown underlying
  density. In addition, we test both the statistical performance and computational
  efficiency of our algorithm on a number of synthetic and real-data experiments.
  Our results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing K-NN based
  anomaly detection algorithms, with significant computational savings.
