title: "{Non-Uniform Stochastic Average Gradient Method for Training Conditional Random
  Fields}"
abstract: We apply stochastic average gradient (SAG) algorithms for training conditional
  random fields (CRFs). We describe a practical implementation that uses structure
  in the CRF gradient to reduce the memory requirement of this linearly-convergent
  stochastic gradient method, propose a non-uniform sampling scheme that substantially
  improves practical performance, and analyze the rate of convergence of the SAGA
  variant under non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results reveal that our method
  significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of the training objective, and
  performs as well or better than optimally-tuned stochastic gradient methods in terms
  of test error.
