title: 'The Bayesian Echo Chamber: Modeling Social Influence via Linguistic Accommodation'
abstract: We present the Bayesian Echo Chamber, a new Bayesian generative model for
  social interaction data. By modeling the evolution of people’s language usage over
  time, this model discovers latent influence relationships between them. Unlike previous
  work on inferring influence, which has primarily focused on simple temporal dynamics
  evidenced via turn-taking behavior, our model captures more nuanced influence relationships,
  evidenced via linguistic accommodation patterns in interaction content. The model,
  which is based on a discrete analog of the multivariate Hawkes process, permits
  a fully Bayesian inference algorithm. We validate our model’s ability to discover
  latent influence patterns using transcripts of arguments heard by the US Supreme
  Court and the movie "12 Angry Men." We showcase our model’s capabilities by using
  it to infer latent influence patterns from Federal Open Market Committee meeting
  transcripts, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance at uncovering social dynamics
  in group discussions.
