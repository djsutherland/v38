title: Sparsistency of \ell_1-Regularized M-Estimators
abstract: We consider the model selection consistency or sparsistency of a broad set
  of \ell_1-regularized M-estimators for linear and non-linear statistical models
  in a unified fashion. For this purpose, we propose the local structured smoothness
  condition (LSSC) on the loss function. We provide a general result giving deterministic
  sufficient conditions for sparsistency in terms of the regularization parameter,
  ambient dimension, sparsity level, and number of measurements. We show that several
  important statistical models have M-estimators that indeed satisfy the LSSC, and
  as a result, the sparsistency guarantees for the corresponding \ell_1-regularized
  M-estimators can be derived as simple applications of our main theorem.
