title: "{Sparse Solutions to Nonnegative Linear Systems and Applications}"
abstract: We give an efficient algorithm for finding sparse approximate solutions
  to linear systems of  equations with nonnegative coefficients. Unlike most known
  results for sparse recovery, we do not require \emphany assumption on the matrix
  other than non-negativity. Our algorithm is combinatorial in nature, inspired by
  techniques for the “set cover” problem, as well as the multiplicative weight update
  method.   We then present a natural application to learning mixture models in the
  PAC framework. For learning a mixture of k axis-aligned Gaussians in d dimensions,
  we give an algorithm that outputs a mixture of O(k/ε^3) Gaussians that is ε-close
  in statistical distance to the true distribution, without any separation assumptions.
  The time and sample complexity is roughly O(kd/ε^3)^d. This is polynomial when d
  is constant – precisely the regime in which known methods fail to identify the components
  efficiently.  Given that non-negativity is a natural assumption, we believe that
  our result may find use in other settings in which we wish to approximately “explain”
  data using a small number of a (large) candidate set of components.
