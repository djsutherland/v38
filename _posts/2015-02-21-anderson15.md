title: Spectral Gap Error Bounds for Improving CUR Matrix Decomposition and the Nyström
  Method
abstract: The CUR matrix decomposition and the related Nyström  method build low-rank
  approximations of data matrices by selecting a small number of representative rows
  and columns of the data.  Here, we introduce novel \emphspectral gap error bounds
  that judiciously exploit the potentially rapid spectrum decay in the input matrix,
  a most common occurrence in machine learning and data analysis. Our error bounds
  are much tighter than existing ones for matrices with rapid spectrum decay, and
  they justify the use of a constant amount of oversampling relative to the rank parameter
  k, i.e, when the number of columns/rows is \ell=k+ O(1).  We demonstrate our analysis
  on a novel deterministic algorithm, \emphStableCUR, which additionally eliminates
  a previously unrecognized source of potential instability in CUR decompositions.  While
  our algorithm accepts any method of row and column selection, we implement it with
  a recent column selection scheme with strong singular value bounds.  Empirical results
  on various classes of real world data matrices demonstrate that our algorithm is
  as efficient as and often outperforms competing algorithms.
