title: Compressed Sensing  with Very Sparse Gaussian Random Projections
abstract: "\\noindent We study the use of \\em very sparse random projections \\citeProc:Li_Hastie_Church_KDD06,Proc:Li_KDD07
  for compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) when the nonzero coordinates of
  signals   can be either positive or negative. In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian
  design matrix are randomly sparsified so that only a very small fraction of  entries
  are nonzero. Our proposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the
  major cost is one linear scan of the coordinates. Using our proposed \\textbf\\em
  “tie estimator”, we are able to recover a K-sparse signal of length N using  1.551
  eK \\log K/δmeasurements (where δ≤0.05 is the confidence) in one scan. The practical
  performance of our method, however, can be substantially better than this bound.
  \  The Gaussian design assumption is not essential although it simplifies the analysis.
  \  \\noindent Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan)
  recovery algorithms using sparse matrices would  require substantially  (e.g., one
  order of magnitude) more measurements than L1 decoding by linear programming, when
  the nonzero coordinates of signals can be either negative or positive.  In this
  paper, following a well-known experimental setup \\citeUrl:wiki_sparse, we show
  that, at the same number of measurements, the recovery accuracies   of our proposed
  method are similar to   the standard L1 decoding."
