title: Falling Rule Lists
abstract: Falling rule lists are classification models consisting of an ordered list
  of if-then rules, where (i) the order of rules determines which example should be
  classified by each rule, and (ii) the estimated probability of success decreases
  monotonically down the list. These kinds of rule lists are inspired by healthcare
  applications where patients would be stratified into risk sets and the highest at-risk
  patients should be considered first. We provide a Bayesian framework for learning
  falling rule lists that does not rely on traditional greedy decision tree learning
  methods.
