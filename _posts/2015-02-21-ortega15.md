title: "{Reactive bandits with attitude}"
abstract: We consider a general class of K-armed bandits that adapt to the actions
  of the player. A single continuous parameter characterizes the “attitude” of the
  bandit, ranging from stochastic to cooperative or to fully adversarial in nature.
  The player seeks to maximize the expected return from the adaptive bandit, and the
  associated optimization problem is related to the free energy of a statistical mechanical
  system under an external field. When the underlying stochastic distribution is Gaussian,
  we derive an analytic solution for the long run optimal player strategy for different
  regimes of the bandit. In the fully adversarial limit, this solution is equivalent
  to the Nash equilibrium of a two-player, zero-sum semi-infinite game. We show how
  optimal strategies can be learned from sequential draws and reward observations
  in these adaptive bandits using Bayesian filtering and Thompson sampling.  Results
  show the qualitative difference in policy pseudo-regret between our proposed strategy
  and other well-known bandit algorithms.
