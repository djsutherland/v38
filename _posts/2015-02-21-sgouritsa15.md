title: "{Inference of Cause and Effect with Unsupervised Inverse Regression}"
abstract: We address the problem of causal discovery in the two-variable case given
  a sample from their joint distribution. The proposed method is based on a known
  assumption that, if X -> Y (X causes Y), the marginal distribution of the cause,
  P(X), contains no information about the conditional distribution P(Y|X). Consequently,
  estimating P(Y|X) from P(X) should not be possible. However, estimating P(X|Y) based
  on P(Y) may be possible.   This paper employs this asymmetry to propose CURE, a
  causal discovery method which decides upon the causal direction by comparing the
  accuracy of the estimations of P(Y|X) and P(X|Y). To this end, we propose a method
  for estimating a conditional from samples of the corresponding marginal, which we
  call unsupervised inverse GP regression. We evaluate CURE on synthetic and real
  data. On the latter, our method outperforms existing causal inference methods.
