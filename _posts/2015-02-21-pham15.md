title: Robust sketching for multiple square-root LASSO problems
abstract: Many learning tasks, such as cross-validation, parameter search, or leave-one-out
  analysis, involve multiple instances of similar problems, each instance sharing
  a large part of learning data with the others. We introduce a robust framework for
  solving multiple square-root LASSO problems, based on a sketch of the learning data
  that uses low-rank approximations. Our approach allows a dramatic reduction in computational
  effort, in effect reducing the number of observations from m (the number of observations
  to start with) to k (the number of singular values retained in the low-rank model),
  while not sacrificing—sometimes even improving—the statistical performance. Theoretical
  analysis, as well as  numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data, illustrate
  the efficiency of the method in large scale applications.
