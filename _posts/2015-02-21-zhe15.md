title: Scalable Nonparametric Multiway Data Analysis
abstract: 'Multiway data analysis deals with multiway arrays, i.e., tensors, and the
  goal is twofold: predicting missing entries by modeling the interactions between
  array elements and discovering hidden patterns, such as clusters or communities
  in each mode. Despite the success of existing tensor factorization approaches, they
  are either unable to capture nonlinear interactions, or computationally expensive
  to handle massive data. In addition, most of the existing methods lack a principled
  way to discover latent clusters, which is important for better understanding of
  the data. To address these issues, we propose a scalable nonparametric tensor decomposition
  model. It employs Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) prior to model the latent clusters;
  it uses local Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture nonlinear relationships and to
  improve scalability. An efficient online variational Bayes Expectation-Maximization
  algorithm is proposed to learn the model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  data show that the proposed model is able to discover latent clusters with higher
  prediction accuracy than competitive methods. Furthermore, the proposed model obtains
  significantly better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art large scale
  tensor decomposition algorithm, GigaTensor, on two large datasets with billions
  of entries.'
