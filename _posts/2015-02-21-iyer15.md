title: "{Submodular Point Processes with Applications to Machine learning}"
abstract: We introduce a class of discrete point processes that we call the \emphSubmodular
  Point Processes (SPPs). These processes are characterized via a submodular (or supermodular)
  function, and naturally model notions of \emphinformation, coverage and \emphdiversity,
  as well as \emphcooperation. Unlike  Log-submodular and Log-supermodular distributions
  (Log-SPPs) such as determinantal point processes (DPPs), SPPs are themselves submodular
  (or supermodular). In this paper, we analyze the computational complexity of probabilistic
  inference in SPPs. We show that computing the partition function for SPPs (and Log-SPPs),
  requires exponential complexity in the worst case, and also provide algorithms which
  approximate SPPs up to polynomial factors. Moreover, for several subclasses of interesting
  submodular functions that occur in applications, we show how we can provide efficient
  closed form expressions for the partition functions, and  thereby marginals and
  conditional distributions. We also show how SPPs are closed under mixtures, thus
  enabling maximum likelihood   based strategies for learning mixtures of submodular
  functions. Finally, we argue how SPPs complement existing Log-SPP distributions,
  and are a natural model for several applications.
