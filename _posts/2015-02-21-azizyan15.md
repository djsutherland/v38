title: Efficient Sparse Clustering of High-Dimensional Non-spherical Gaussian Mixtures
abstract: We consider the problem of clustering data points in high dimensions, i.e.,
  when the number of data points may be much smaller than the number of dimensions.
  Specifically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with two non-spherical
  Gaussian components, where the clusters are distinguished by only a few relevant
  dimensions. The method we propose is a combination of a recent approach for learning
  parameters of a Gaussian mixture model and sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA).
  In addition to cluster assignments, the method returns an estimate of the set of
  features relevant for clustering. Our results indicate that the sample complexity
  of clustering depends on the sparsity of the relevant feature set, while only scaling
  logarithmically with the ambient dimension. Further, we require much milder assumptions
  than existing work on clustering in high dimensions. In particular, we do not require
  spherical clusters nor necessitate mean separation along relevant dimensions.
