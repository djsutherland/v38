title: "{Scalable Optimization of Randomized Operational  Decisions in Adversarial
  Classification Settings}"
abstract: 'When learning, such as classification, is used in adversarial settings,
  such as intrusion detection, intelligent adversaries will attempt to evade the resulting
  policies. The literature on adversarial machine learning aims to develop learning
  algorithms which are robust to such adversarial evasion, but exhibits two significant
  limitations: a) failure to account for operational constraints and b) a restriction
  that decisions are deterministic. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
  conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and
  operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational
  constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably
  large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel
  method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational
  decision function. Additionally, we develop an iterative constraint generation approach
  which embeds adversaryâ€™s best response calculation, to arrive at a scalable algorithm
  for computing near-optimal randomized operational decisions. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.'
