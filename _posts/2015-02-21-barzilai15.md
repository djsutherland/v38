title: Convex Multi-Task Learning by Clustering
abstract: We consider the problem of multi-task learning in which tasks belong to
  hidden clusters. We formulate the learning problem as a novel convex optimization
  problem in which linear classifiers are combinations of (a small number of) some
  basis. Our formulation jointly learns both the basis and the linear combination.
  We propose a scalable optimization algorithm for finding the optimal solution. Our
  new methods outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on multi-task sentiment
  classification tasks.
