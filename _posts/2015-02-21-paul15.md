title: Feature Selection for Linear SVM with Provable Guarantees
abstract: We give two provably accurate feature-selection techniques for the linear
  SVM. The algorithms run in deterministic and randomized time respectively. Our algorithms
  can be used in an unsupervised or supervised setting. The supervised approach is
  based on sampling features from support vectors. We prove that the margin in the
  feature space is preserved to within Îµ-relative error of the margin in the full
  feature space in the worst-case. In the unsupervised setting, we also provide worst-case
  guarantees of the radius of the minimum enclosing ball, thereby ensuring comparable
  generalization as in the full feature space and resolving an open problem posed
  in Dasgupta et al. We present extensive experiments on real-world datasets to support
  our theory and to demonstrate that our methods are competitive and often better
  than prior state-of-the-art, for which there are no known provable guarantees.
