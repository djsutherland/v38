title: On Anomaly Ranking and Excess-Mass Curves
abstract: Learning how to rank multivariate unlabeled observations depending on their
  degree of abnormality/novelty is a crucial problem in a wide range of applications.
  In practice, it generally consists in building a real valued "scoring" function
  on the feature space so as to quantify to which extent observations should be considered
  as abnormal.  In the 1-d situation, measurements are generally considered as ”abnormal”
  when they are remote from central measures such as the mean or the median. Anomaly
  detection then relies on tail analysis of the variable of interest. Extensions to
  the multivariate setting are far from straightforward and it is precisely the main
  purpose of this paper to introduce a novel and convenient (functional) criterion
  for measuring the performance of a scoring function regarding the anomaly ranking
  task, referred to as the Excess-Mass curve (EM-curve). In addition, an adaptive
  algorithm for building a scoring function based on unlabeled data with a nearly
  optimal EM is proposed and is analyzed from a statistical perspective.
