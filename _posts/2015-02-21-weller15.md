title: Revisiting the Limits of MAP Inference by MWSS on Perfect Graphs
abstract: A recent, promising approach to identifying a configuration of a discrete
  graphical model with highest probability (termed MAP inference) is to reduce the
  problem to finding a maximum weight stable set (MWSS) in a derived weighted graph,
  which, if perfect, allows a solution to be found in polynomial time.  Weller and
  Jebara (2013) investigated the class of binary pairwise models where this method
  may be applied. However, their analysis made a seemingly innocuous assumption which
  simplifies analysis but led to only a subset of possible reparameterizations being
  considered. Here we introduce novel techniques and consider all cases, demonstrating
  that this greatly expands the set of tractable models. We provide a simple, exact
  characterization of the new, enlarged set and show how such models may be efficiently
  identified, thus settling the power of the approach on this class.
