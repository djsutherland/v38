title: "{Modeling Skill Acquisition Over Time with Sequence and Topic Modeling}"
abstract: Online education provides data from students solving problems at different
  levels of proficiency over time. Unfortunately, methods that use these data for
  inferring student knowledge rely on costly domain expertise. We propose three novel
  data-driven methods that bridge sequence modeling with topic models to infer students’
  time varying knowledge. These methods differ in complexity, interpretability, accuracy
  and human supervision. For example, our most interpretable method has similar classification
  accuracy to the models created by domain experts, but requires much less effort.
  On the other hand, the most accurate method is completely data-driven and improves
  predictions by up to 15% in AUC, an evaluation metric for classifiers.
