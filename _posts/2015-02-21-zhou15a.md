title: Infinite Edge Partition Models for Overlapping Community Detection and Link
  Prediction
abstract: A hierarchical gamma process infinite edge partition model is proposed to
  factorize the binary adjacency matrix of an unweighted undirected relational network
  under a  Bernoulli-Poisson link. The model describes  both homophily and stochastic
  equivalence, and is scalable to  big sparse networks by focusing its computation
  on  pairs of linked nodes. It can not only discover overlapping communities and
  inter-community interactions, but also predict missing edges. A simplified version
  omitting inter-community interactions is also provided and we reveal its  interesting
  connections to existing models. The number of communities is automatically inferred
  in a nonparametric Bayesian manner, and efficient  inference via Gibbs sampling
  is derived using novel data augmentation techniques. Experimental results on four
  real networks demonstrate the modelsâ€™ scalability and state-of-the-art performance.
