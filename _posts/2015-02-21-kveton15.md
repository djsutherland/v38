title: "{Tight Regret Bounds for Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits}"
abstract: A stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit is an online learning problem where
  at each step a learning agent chooses a subset of ground items subject to constraints,
  and then observes stochastic weights of these items and receives their sum as a
  payoff. In this paper, we close the problem of computationally and sample efficient
  learning in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits. In particular, we analyze a UCB-like
  algorithm for solving the problem, which is known to be computationally efficient;
  and prove O(K L (1 / ∆) \log n) and O(\sqrtK L n \log n) upper bounds on its n-step
  regret, where L is the number of ground items, K is the maximum number of chosen
  items, and ∆is the gap between the expected returns of the optimal and best suboptimal
  solutions. The gap-dependent bound is tight up to a constant factor and the gap-free
  bound is tight up to a polylogarithmic factor.
