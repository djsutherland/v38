title: On Approximate Non-submodular Minimization via Tree-Structured Supermodularity
abstract: We address the problem of minimizing non-submodular functions where the
  supermodularity is restricted to tree-structured pairwise terms. We are motivated
  by several real world applications, which require submodularity along with structured
  supermodularity, and this forms a rich class of expressive models, where the non-submodularity
  is restricted to a tree. While this problem is NP hard (as we show), we develop
  several practical algorithms to find approximate and near-optimal solutions for
  this problem, some of which provide lower and others of which provide upper bounds
  thereby allowing us to compute a tightness gap. We also show that some of our algorithms
  can be extended to handle more general forms of supermodularity restricted to arbitrary
  pairwise terms. We compare our algorithms on synthetic data, and also demonstrate
  the advantage of the formulation on the real world application of image segmentation,
  where we incorporate structured supermodularity into higher-order submodular energy
  minimization.
