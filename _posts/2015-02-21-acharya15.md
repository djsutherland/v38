title: Nonparametric Bayesian Factor Analysis for Dynamic Count Matrices
abstract: A gamma process dynamic Poisson factor analysis model is proposed to factorize
  a dynamic count matrix, whose columns are sequentially observed count vectors. The
  model builds a novel  Markov chain that sends the latent gamma random variables
  at time (t-1) as the shape parameters of those at time t, which are linked to observed
  or latent counts under the Poisson likelihood.  The significant challenge of inferring
  the gamma shape parameters is fully addressed, using unique data augmentation and
  marginalization techniques for the negative binomial distribution. The same nonparametric
  Bayesian model also applies to the factorization of a dynamic binary matrix, via
  a Bernoulli-Poisson link that connects a binary observation to a latent count, with
  closed-form conditional posteriors for the latent counts and efficient computation
  for sparse observations. We apply the model to text and music analysis, with state-of-the-art
  results.
