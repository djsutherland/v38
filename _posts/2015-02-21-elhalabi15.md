title: A totally unimodular view of structured sparsity
abstract: This paper describes a simple framework for structured sparse recovery based
  on convex optimization. We show that many structured sparsity models can be naturally
  represented by linear matrix inequalities on the support of the unknown parameters,
  where the constraint matrix has a totally unimodular (TU) structure.  For such structured
  models, tight convex relaxations can be obtained in polynomial time via linear programming.
  Our modeling framework unifies the prevalent structured sparsity norms in the literature,
  introduces new interesting ones, and renders their tightness and tractability arguments
  transparent.
