title: Scalable Variational Gaussian Process Classification
abstract: Gaussian process classification is a popular method with a number of appealing
  properties. We show how to scale the model within a variational inducing point framework,
  out-performing the state of the art on benchmark datasets. Importantly, the variational
  formulation an be exploited to allow classification in problems with millions of
  data points, as we demonstrate in experiments.
