title: "{A Topic Modeling Approach to Ranking}"
abstract: We propose a topic modeling approach to the prediction of preferences in
  pairwise comparisons. We develop a new generative model for pairwise comparisons
  that accounts for multiple shared latent rankings that are prevalent in a population
  of users. This new model also captures inconsistent user behavior in a natural way.
  We show how the estimation of latent rankings in the new generative model can be
  formally reduced to the estimation of topics in a statistically equivalent topic
  modeling problem. We leverage recent advances in the topic modeling literature to
  develop an algorithm that can learn shared latent rankings with provable consistency
  as well as sample and computational complexity guarantees. We demonstrate that the
  new approach is empirically competitive with the current state-of-the-art approaches
  in predicting preferences on some semi-synthetic and real world datasets.
