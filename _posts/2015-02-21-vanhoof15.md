title: "{Learning of Non-Parametric Control Policies with High-Dimensional State Features}"
abstract: Learning complex control policies from high-dimensional sensory input is
  a challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. Kernel methods that approximate
  values functions or transition models can address this problem. Yet, many current
  approaches rely on instable greedy maximization. In this paper, we develop a policy
  search algorithm  that integrates robust policy updates and kernel embeddings. Our
  method can learn non-parametric control policies for infinite horizon continuous
  MDPs with high-dimensional sensory representations. We show that our method outperforms
  related approaches, and that our algorithm can learn an underpowered swing-up task
  task directly from high-dimensional image data.
