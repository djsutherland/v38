title: "{Online Ranking with Top-1 Feedback}"
abstract: 'We consider a setting where a system learns to rank a fixed set of m items.
  The goal is produce good item rankings for users with diverse interests who interact
  online with the system for T rounds. We consider a novel top-1 feedback model: at
  the end of each round, the relevance score for only the top ranked object is revealed.
  However, the performance of the system is judged on the entire ranked list. We provide
  a comprehensive set of results regarding learnability under this challenging setting.
  For PairwiseLoss and DCG, two popular ranking measures, we prove that the minimax
  regret is Î˜(T^2/3). Moreover, the minimax regret is achievable using an efficient
  strategy that only spends O(m \log m) time per round. The same efficient strategy
  achieves O(T^2/3) regret for Precision@k. Surprisingly, we show that for normalized
  versions of these ranking measures, i.e., AUC, NDCG & MAP, no online ranking algorithm
  can have sublinear regret.'
