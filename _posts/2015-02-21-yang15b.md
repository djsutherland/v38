title: A la Carte â€“ Learning Fast Kernels
abstract: Kernel methods have great promise for learning rich statistical representations
  of large modern datasets. However, compared to neural networks, kernel methods have
  been perceived as lacking in scalability and flexibility. We introduce a family
  of fast, flexible, general purpose, and lightly parametrized kernel learning methods,
  derived from Fastfood basis function expansions. We provide mechanisms to learn
  the properties of groups of spectral frequencies in these expansions, which require
  only O(m log d) time and O(m) memory, for m basis functions and d input dimensions.
  We show that the proposed methods can learn a wide class of kernels, outperforming
  the alternatives in accuracy, speed, and memory consumption.
