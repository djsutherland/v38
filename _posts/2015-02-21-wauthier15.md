title: A Greedy Homotopy Method for Regression with Nonconvex Constraints
abstract: The goal of this paper is to estimate sparse linear regression models, where
  for a given partition \mathcalG of input variables, the selected variables are chosen
  from a \it diverse set of groups in \mathcalG. We consider a novel class of nonconvex
  constraint functions, and develop RepLasso, a greedy homotopy method that exploits
  geometrical properties of the constraint functions to build a sequence of suitably
  adapted convex surrogate problems. We prove that in some situations RepLasso recovers
  the global minima path of the nonconvex problem. Moreover, even if it does not recover
  the global minima, we prove that it will often do no worse than the Lasso in terms
  of (signed) support recovery, while in practice outperforming it. We show empirically
  that the strategy can also be used to improve over various other Lasso-style algorithms.
  Finally, a GWAS of ankylosing spondylitis highlights our methodâ€™s practical utility.
