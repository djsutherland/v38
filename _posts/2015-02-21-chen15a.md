title: "{One-bit Compressed Sensing with the k-Support Norm}"
abstract: In one-bit compressed sensing (1-bit CS), one attempts to estimate a structured
  parameter (signal) only using the sign of suitable linear measurements. In this
  paper, we investigate 1-bit CS problems for sparse signals using the recently proposed
  k-support norm. We show that the new estimator has a closed-form solution, so no
  optimization is needed. We establish consistency and recovery guarantees of the
  estimator for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian random measurements. For Gaussian measurements,
  our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees
  on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible
  error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement
  vectors. In both cases, our analysis covers the setting of model misspecification,
  i.e., when the true sparsity is unknown. Experimental results illustrate several
  strengths of the new estimator.
