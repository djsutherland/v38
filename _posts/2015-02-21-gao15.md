title: "{Efficient Estimation of Mutual Information for Strongly Dependent Variables}"
abstract: We demonstrate that a popular class of non-parametric mutual information
  (MI) estimators based on k-nearest-neighbor graphs requires number of samples that
  scales exponentially with the true MI. Consequently, accurate estimation of MI between
  two strongly dependent variables is possible only for prohibitively large sample
  size. This important yet overlooked shortcoming of the existing estimators is due
  to their implicit reliance on  local uniformity of the underlying joint distribution.
  We introduce a new  estimator that is robust to local non-uniformity, works well
  with limited data, and is able to capture relationship strengths over many orders
  of magnitude. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed estimator
  on both synthetic and real-world data.
