title: "{A Spectral Algorithm for Inference in Hidden semi-Markov Models}"
abstract: Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are latent variable models which allow
  latent state persistence and can be viewed as a generalization of the popular hidden
  Markov models (HMMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral algorithm to
  perform inference in HSMMs. Our approach is based on estimating certain sample moments,
  whose order depends only logarithmically on the maximum length of the hidden state
  persistence. Moreover, the algorithm requires only a few spectral decompositions
  and is therefore computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and
  real data demonstrate the promise of the algorithm.
