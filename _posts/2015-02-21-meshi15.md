title: Efficient Training of Structured SVMs via Soft Constraints
abstract: Structured output prediction is a powerful framework for jointly predicting
  interdependent output labels. Learning the parameters of structured predictors is
  a central task in machine learning applications. However, training the model from
  data often becomes computationally expensive. Several methods have been proposed
  to exploit the model structure, or decomposition, in order to obtain efficient training
  algorithms. In particular, methods based on linear programming relaxation, or dual
  decomposition, decompose the prediction task into multiple simpler prediction tasks
  and enforce agreement between overlapping predictions. In this work we observe that
  relaxing these agreement constraints and replacing them with soft constraints yields
  a much easier optimization problem. Based on this insight we propose an alternative
  training objective, analyze its theoretical properties, and derive an algorithm
  for its optimization. Our method, based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, achieves significant
  speedups over existing state-of-the-art methods without hurting prediction accuracy.
