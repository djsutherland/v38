title: Learning from Data with Heterogeneous Noise using SGD
abstract: 'We consider learning from data of variable quality that may be obtained
  from different heterogeneous sources. Addressing learning from heterogeneous data
  in its full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead
  a model in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise level
  reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic gradient
  algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two concrete examples
  where this problem arises naturally: learning with local differential privacy based
  on data from multiple sources with different privacy requirements, and learning
  from data with labels of variable quality.  The main contribution of this paper
  is to identify how heterogeneous noise impacts performance. We show that given two
  datasets with heterogeneous noise, the order in which to use them in standard SGD
  depends on the learning rate. We propose a method for changing the learning rate
  as a function of the heterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in
  two cases of interest. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on
  real data.'
