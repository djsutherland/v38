title: Tensor Factorization via Matrix Factorization
abstract: Tensor factorization arises in many machine learning applications, such
  as knowledge base modeling and parameter estimation in latent variable models. However,
  numerical methods for tensor factorization have not reached the level of maturity
  of matrix factorization methods. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for CP
  tensor factorization that uses random projections to reduce the problem to simultaneous
  matrix diagonalization. Our method is conceptually simple and also applies to non-orthogonal
  and asymmetric tensors of arbitrary order. We prove that a small number random projections
  essentially preserves the spectral information in the tensor, allowing us to remove
  the dependence on the eigengap that plagued earlier tensor-to-matrix reductions.
  Experimentally, our method outperforms existing tensor factorization methods on
  both simulated data and two real datasets.
