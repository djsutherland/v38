title: Calibration of conditional composite likelihood for Bayesian inference on Gibbs
  random fields
abstract: Gibbs random fields play an important role in statistics, however, the resulting
  likelihood is typically unavailable due to an intractable normalizing constant.
  Composite likelihoods offer a principled means to construct useful approximations.
  This paper provides a mean to calibrate the posterior distribution resulting from
  using a composite likelihood and illustrate its performance in several examples.
