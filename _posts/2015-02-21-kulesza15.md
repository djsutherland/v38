title: Low-Rank Spectral Learning with Weighted Loss Functions
abstract: Kulesza et al. recently observed that low-rank spectral learning algorithms,
  which discard the smallest singular values of a moment matrix during training, can
  behave in unexpected ways, producing large errors even when the discarded singular
  values are arbitrarily small.  In this paper we prove that when learning predictive
  state representations those problematic cases disappear if we introduce a particular
  weighted loss function and learn using sufficiently large sets of statistics; our
  main result is a bound on the loss of the learned low-rank model in terms of the
  singular values that are discarded.  Practically speaking, this suggests that regardless
  of the model rank we should use the largest possible sets of statistics, and we
  show empirically that this is true on both synthetic and real-world domains.
