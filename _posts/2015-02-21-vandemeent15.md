title: Particle Gibbs with Ancestor Sampling for Probabilistic Programs
abstract: Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques rank among current state-of-the-art
  methods for probabilistic program inference. A drawback of these techniques is that
  they rely on importance resampling, which results in degenerate particle trajectories
  and a low effective sample size for variables sampled early in a program. We here
  develop a formalism to adapt ancestor resampling, a technique that mitigates particle
  degeneracy, to the probabilistic programming setting. We present empirical results
  that demonstrate nontrivial performance gains.
