title: Exact Bayesian Learning of Ancestor Relations in Bayesian Networks
abstract: Ancestor relations in Bayesian networks (BNs) encode long-range causal relations
  among random variables. In this paper, we develop dynamic programming (DP) algorithms
  to compute the exact posterior probabilities of ancestor relations in Bayesian networks.
  Previous algorithm by Parviainen and Koivisto (2011) evaluates all possible ancestor
  relations in time O(n3^n) and space O(3^n). However, their algorithm assumes an
  order-modular prior over DAGs that does not respect Markov equivalence. The resulting
  posteriors would bias towards DAGs consistent with more linear orders. To adhere
  to the uniform prior, we develop a new DP algorithm that computes the exact posteriors
  of all possible ancestor relations in time O(n^25^n-1) and space O(3^n). We also
  discuss the extension of our algorithm to computing the posteriors of s >p >t relations,
  i.e., a directed path from s to t via p. We apply our algorithm to a biological
  data set for discovering protein signaling pathways.
