title: "{A Simple Homotopy Algorithm for Compressive Sensing}"
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of recovering the s largest elements
  of an arbitrary vector from noisy measurements. Inspired by previous work, we develop
  an homotopy algorithm which solves the \ell_1-regularized least square problem for
  a sequence of decreasing values of the regularization parameter. Compared to the
  previous method, our algorithm is more efficient in the sense it only updates the
  solution once for each intermediate problem, and more practical in the sense it
  has a simple stopping criterion by checking the sparsity of the intermediate solution.
  Theoretical analysis reveals that our method enjoys a linear convergence rate in
  reducing the recovery error. Furthermore, our guarantee for recovering the top s
  elements of the target vector is tighter than previous results, and that for recovering
  the target vector itself matches the state of the art in compressive sensing.
