title: Near-optimal max-affine estimators for convex regression
abstract: This paper considers least squares estimators for regression problems over
  convex, uniformly bounded, uniformly Lipschitz function classes minimizing the empirical
  risk over max-affine functions (the maximum of finitely many affine functions).
  Based on new results on nonlinear nonparametric regression and on the approximation
  accuracy of max-affine functions, these estimators are proved to achieve the optimal
  rate of convergence up to logarithmic factors. Preliminary experiments indicate
  that a simple randomized approximation to the optimal estimator is competitive with
  state-of-the-art alternatives.
