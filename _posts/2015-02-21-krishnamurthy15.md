title: On Estimating L_2^2 Divergence
abstract: We give a comprehensive theoretical characterization of a nonparametric
  estimator for the L_2^2 divergence between two continuous distributions. We first
  bound the rate of convergence of our estimator, showing that it is \sqrtn-consistent
  provided the densities are sufficiently smooth. In this smooth regime, we then show
  that our estimator is asymptotically normal, construct asymptotic confidence intervals,
  and establish a Berry-Ess√©en style inequality characterizing the rate of convergence
  to normality. We also show that this estimator is minimax optimal.
