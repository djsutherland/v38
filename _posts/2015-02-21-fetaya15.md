title: "{Graph Approximation and Clustering on a Budget}"
abstract: We consider the problem of learning from a similarity matrix (such as spectral
  clustering and low-dimensional embedding), when computing pairwise similarities
  are costly, and only a limited number of entries can be observed. We provide a theoretical
  analysis using standard notions of graph approximation, significantly generalizing
  previous results, which focused on spectral clustering with two clusters. We also
  propose a new algorithmic approach based on adaptive sampling, which experimentally
  matches or improves on previous methods, while being considerably more general and
  computationally cheaper.
