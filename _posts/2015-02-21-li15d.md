title: Max-Margin Zero-Shot Learning for Multi-class Classification
abstract: Due to the dramatic expanse of data categories and the lack of labeled instances,
  zero-shot learning, which transfers knowledge from observed classes to recognize
  unseen classes, has started drawing a lot of attention from the research community.
  In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised max-margin learning framework that integrates
  the semi-supervised classification problem over observed classes and the unsupervised
  clustering problem over unseen classes together to tackle zero-shot multi-class
  classification. By further integrating label embedding into this framework, we produce
  a dual formulation that permits convenient incorporation of auxiliary label semantic
  knowledge to improve zero-shot learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three
  standard image data sets to evaluate the proposed approach by comparing to two state-of-the-art
  methods. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.
