title: Symmetric Iterative Proportional Fitting
abstract: 'Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) generates from an input matrix W a
  sequence of matrices that converges, under certain conditions, to a specific limit
  matrix W*. This limit is the relative-entropy nearest solution to W among all matrices
  of prescribed row marginals r and column marginals c. We prove this known fact by
  a novel strategy that contributes a pure algorithmic intuition. Then we focus on
  the symmetric setting: W=Wâ€™ and r=c. Since IPF inherently generates non-symmetric
  matrices, we introduce two symmetrized variants of IPF. We prove convergence for
  both of them. Further, we give a novel characterization for the existence of W*
  in terms of expansion properties of the undirected weighted graph represented by
  W. Finally, we show how our results contribute to recent work in machine learning.'
