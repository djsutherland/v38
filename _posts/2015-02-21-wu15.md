title: "{Understanding and Evaluating Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis}"
abstract: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) represents a simple yet powerful technique
  for partitioning a p-dimensional feature vector into one of K classes based on a
  linear projection learned from N labeled observations. However, it is well-established
  that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator
  degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number
  of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general
  categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number
  of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based
  on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been
  heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation.
  In contrast, a second strategy applies sparse penalty functions directly to the
  original LDA objective but requires additional heuristic trade-off parameters, has
  unknown global and local minima properties, and requires a greedy sequential optimization
  procedure. In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no
  rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable.
  Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms
  and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular,
  complementary sparse regularizer. This overall process ultimately progresses our
  understanding of sparse LDA in general, while leading to targeted modifications
  of existing algorithms that produce superior results in practice on three high-dimensional
  gene data sets.
