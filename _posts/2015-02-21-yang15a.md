title: Majorization-Minimization for Manifold Embedding
abstract: 'Nonlinear dimensionality reduction by manifold embedding has become a popular
  and powerful approach both for visualization and as preprocessing for predictive
  tasks, but more efficient optimization algorithms are still crucially needed.  Majorization-Minimization
  (MM) is a promising approach that monotonically decreases the cost function, but
  it remains unknown how to tightly majorize the manifold embedding objective functions
  such that the resulting MM algorithms are efficient and robust. We propose a new
  MM procedure that yields fast MM algorithms for a wide variety of manifold embedding
  problems. In our majorization step, two parts of the cost function are respectively
  upper bounded by quadratic and Lipschitz surrogates, and the resulting upper bound
  can be minimized in closed form. For cost functions amenable to such QL-majorization,
  the MM yields monotonic improvement and is efficient: in experiments the newly developed
  MM algorithms outperform five state-of-the-art optimization approaches in manifold
  embedding tasks.'
