title: 'Back to the Past: Source Identification in Diffusion Networks from Partially
  Observed Cascades'
abstract: When a piece of malicious information becomes rampant in an information
  diffusion network, can we identify the source node that originally introduced the
  piece into the network and infer the time when it initiated this? Being able to
  do so is critical for curtailing the spread of malicious information, and reducing
  the potential losses incurred. This is a very challenging problem since typically
  only incomplete traces are observed and we need to unroll the incomplete traces
  into the past in order to pinpoint the source. In this paper, we tackle this problem
  by developing a two-stage framework, which first learns a continuous-time diffusion
  network based on historical diffusion traces and then identifies the source of an
  incomplete diffusion trace by maximizing the likelihood of the trace under the learned
  model. Experiments on both large synthetic and real-world data show that our framework
  can effectively go back to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation
  time  significantly more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.
