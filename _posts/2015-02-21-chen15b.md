title: Efficient Second-Order Gradient Boosting for Conditional Random Fields
abstract: Conditional random fields (CRFs) are an important class of models for accurate
  structured prediction, but effective design of the feature functions is a major
  challenge when applying CRF models to real world data. Gradient boosting, which
  is used to automatically induce and select feature functions, is a natural candidate
  solution to the problem.  However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting
  algorithms for CRFs due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies.
  Existing approaches thus use only first-order information when optimizing likelihood,
  and hence face convergence issues. We incorporate second-order information by deriving
  a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient
  boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective
  function.  The resulting algorithm induces and selects features for CRFs via functional
  space optimization, with provable convergence guarantees.  Experimental results
  on three real world datasets demonstrate that the mixing rate based upper bound
  is effective for learning CRFs with non-linear potentials.
