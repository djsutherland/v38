title: Deep Exponential Families
abstract: We describe deep exponential families (DEFs), a class of latent variable
  models that are inspired by the hidden structures used in deep neural networks.
  DEFs capture a hierarchy of dependencies between latent variables, and are easily
  generalized to many settings through exponential families. We perform inference
  using recent â€œblack box" variational inference techniques. We then evaluate various
  DEFs on text and combine multiple DEFs into a model for pairwise recommendation
  data. In an extensive study, we show that going beyond one layer improves predictions
  for DEFs. We demonstrate that DEFs find interesting exploratory structure in large
  data sets, and give better predictive performance than state-of-the-art models.
