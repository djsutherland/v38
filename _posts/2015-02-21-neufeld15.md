title: Variance Reduction via Antithetic Markov Chains
abstract: We present a Monte Carlo integration method, antithetic Markov chain sampling
  (AMCS), that incorporates local Markov transitions in an underlying importance sampler.
  Like sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the proposed method uses a sequence of Markov
  transitions to adapt the sampling to favour more influential regions of the integrand
  (modes). However, AMCS differs in the type of transitions that may be used, the
  number of Markov chains, and the method of chain termination. In particular, from
  each point sampled from an initial proposal, AMCS collects a sequence of points
  by simulating two independent, but antithetic, Markov chains, each terminated by
  a sample-dependent stopping rule. This approach provides greater flexibility for
  targeting influential areas while eliminating the need to fix the length of the
  Markov chain a priori. We show that the resulting estimator is unbiased and can
  reduce variance on peaked multi-modal integrands that challenge existing methods.
