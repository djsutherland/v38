title: Preserving Privacy of Continuous High-dimensional Data with Minimax Filters
abstract: 'Preserving privacy of high-dimensional and continuous data such as images
  or biometric data is a challenging problem. This paper formulates this problem as
  a learning game between three parties: 1) data contributors using a filter to sanitize
  data samples, 2) a cooperative data aggregator learning a target task using the
  filtered samples, and 3) an adversary learning to identify contributors using the
  same filtered samples. Minimax filters that achieve the optimal privacy-utility
  trade-off from broad families of filters and loss/classifiers are defined, and algorithms
  for learning the filers in batch or distributed settings are presented. Experiments
  with several real-world tasks including facial expression recognition, speech emotion
  recognition, and activity recognition from motion, show that the minimax filter
  can simultaneously achieve similar or better target task accuracy and lower privacy
  risk, often significantly lower than previous methods.'
