title: A Scalable Algorithm for Structured Kernel Feature Selection
abstract: Kernel methods are powerful tools for nonlinear feature representation.
  Incorporated with structured LASSO, the kernelized structured LASSO is an effective
  feature selection approach that can preserve the nonlinear input-output relationships
  as well as the structured sparseness. But as the data dimension increases, the method
  can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper we propose a stochastic
  optimization algorithm that can efficiently address this computational problem on
  account of the redundant kernel representations of the given data. Experiments on
  simulation data and PET 3D brain image data show that our method can achieve superior
  accuracy with less computational cost than existing methods.
