title: "{Sensor Selection for Crowdsensing Dynamical Systems}"
abstract: We model crowdsensing as the selection of sensors with unknown variance
  to monitor a large linear dynamical system. To achieve low estimation error, we
  propose a Thompson sampling approach combining submodular optimization and a scalable
  online variational inference algorithm to maintain the posterior distribution over
  the variance. We also consider three alternative parameter estimation algorithms.
  We illustrate the behavior of our sensor selection algorithms on real traffic data
  from the city of Dublin. Our online algorithm achieves significantly lower estimation
  error than sensor selection using a fixed variance value for all sensors.
