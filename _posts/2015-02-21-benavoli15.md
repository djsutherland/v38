title: Gaussian Processes  for  Bayesian hypothesis tests on regression functions
abstract: Gaussian processes have been used in different application domains such
  as classification, regression etc. In this paper we show that they can also be employed
  as a universal tool for developing a large variety of Bayesian statistical hypothesis
  tests for regression functions. In particular, we will use GPs for testing whether
  (i) two functions are equal; (ii) a function is monotone (even accounting for seasonality
  effects); (iii) a function is periodic; (iv) two functions are proportional. By
  simulation studies, we will show that, beside being more flexible, GP tests are
  also competitive in terms of performance with state-of-art algorithms.
