title: "{Fast Function to Function Regression}"
abstract: We analyze the problem of regression when both input covariates and output
  responses are functions from a nonparametric function class. Function to function
  regression (FFR) covers a large range of interesting applications including time-series
  prediction problems, and also more general tasks like studying a mapping between
  two separate types of distributions. However, previous nonparametric estimators
  for FFR type problems scale badly computationally with the number of input/output
  pairs in a data-set. Given the complexity of a mapping between general functions
  it may be necessary to consider large data-sets in order to achieve a low estimation
  risk. To address this issue, we develop a novel scalable nonparametric estimator,
  the Triple-Basis Estimator (3BE), which is capable of operating over datasets with
  many instances. To the best of our knowledge, the 3BE is the first nonparametric
  FFR estimator that can scale to massive data-sets. We analyze the 3BEâ€™s risk and
  derive an upperbound rate. Furthermore, we show an improvement of several orders
  of magnitude in terms of prediction speed and a reduction in error over previous
  estimators in various real-world data-sets.
