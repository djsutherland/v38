title: "{Streaming Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture Models}"
abstract: In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming
  data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity based on the amount
  of data observed. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice;
  existing inference algorithms either are not applicable to streaming applications
  or are not extensible to nonparametric models.  For the special case of Dirichlet
  processes, streaming inference has been considered.  However, there is growing interest
  in more flexible BNP models, in particular building on the class of normalized random
  measures (NRMs).  We work within this general framework and present a streaming
  variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models based on assumed density
  filtering.  Extensions to expectation propagation algorithms are possible in the
  batch data setting.  We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on clustering
  documents in large, streaming text corpora.
