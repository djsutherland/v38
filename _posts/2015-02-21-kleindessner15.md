title: Dimensionality estimation without distances
abstract: While existing methods for estimating the intrinsic dimension of datasets
  require to know distances between data points, we consider a situation where one
  has considerably less information. Given a sample of points, all we get to see is
  who are the k nearest neighbors of every point. In other words, we get the adjacency
  matrix of the directed, unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph on the sample, but do
  not know any point coordinates or distances between the points. We provide two estimators
  for this situation, a naive one and a more elaborate one. Both of them can be proved
  to be statistically consistent. However, further theoretical and experimental evidence
  shows that the naive estimator performs rather poorly, whereas the elaborate one
  achieves results comparable to those of estimators based on distance information.
