title: Two-stage sampled learning theory on distributions
abstract: 'We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to a real-valued
  response from a probability distribution. Although there exist a large number of
  similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization
  performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions
  have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled
  distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed
  between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with
  consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation
  as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions),
  and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide
  theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve
  the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our
  main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage
  sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed
  with kernels). As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish
  the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002]
  in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due
  to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].'
