title: "{Stochastic Structured Variational Inference}"
abstract: Stochastic variational inference makes it possible to approximate posterior
  distributions induced by large datasets quickly using stochastic optimization. The
  algorithm relies on the use of fully factorized variational distributions. However,
  this “mean-field” independence approximation limits the fidelity of the posterior
  approximation, and introduces local optima. We show how to relax the mean-field
  approximation to allow arbitrary dependencies between global parameters and local
  hidden variables, producing better parameter estimates by reducing bias, sensitivity
  to local optima, and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
