title: "{State Space Methods for Efficient Inference in Student-t Process Regression}"
abstract: The added flexibility of Student-t processes (TPs) over Gaussian processes
  (GPs) robustifies inference in outlier-contaminated noisy data. The uncertainties
  are better accounted for than in GP regression, because the predictive covariances
  explicitly depend on the training observations. For an entangled noise model, the
  canonical-form TP regression problem can be solved analytically, but the naive TP
  and GP solutions share the same cubic computational cost in the number of training
  observations. We show how a large class of temporal TP regression models can be
  reformulated as state space models, and how a forward filtering and backward smoothing
  recursion can be derived for solving the inference analytically in linear time complexity.
  This is a novel finding that generalizes the previously known connection between
  Gaussian process regression and Kalman filtering to more general elliptical processes
  and non-Gaussian Bayesian filtering. We derive this connection, demonstrate the
  benefits of the approach with examples, and finally apply the method to empirical
  data.
