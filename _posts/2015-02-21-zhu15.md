title: The Log-Shift Penalty for Adaptive Estimation of Multiple Gaussian Graphical
  Models
abstract: Sparse Gaussian graphical models characterize sparse dependence relationships
  between random variables in a network. To estimate multiple related Gaussian graphical
  models on the same set of variables, we formulate a hierarchical model, which leads
  to an optimization problem with a nonconvex log-shift penalty function. We show
  that under mild conditions the optimization problem is convex despite the inclusion
  of a nonconvex penalty, and derive an efficient optimization algorithm. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed method is able to achieve
  good selection and estimation performance simultaneously, because the nonconvexity
  of the log-shift penalty allows for weak signals to be thresholded to zero without
  excessive shrinkage on the strong signals.
