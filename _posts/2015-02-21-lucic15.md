title: "{Tradeoffs for Space, Time, Data and Risk in Unsupervised Learning}"
abstract: Faced with massive data, is it possible to trade off (statistical) risk,
  and (computational) space and time? This challenge lies at the heart of large-scale
  machine learning. Using k-means clustering as a prototypical unsupervised learning
  problem, we show how we can strategically summarize the data (control space) in
  order to trade off risk and time when data is generated by a probabilistic model.
  Our summarization is based on coreset constructions from computational geometry.
  We also develop an algorithm, TRAM, to navigate the space/time/data/risk tradeoff
  in practice. In particular, we show that for a fixed risk (or data size), as the
  data size  increases (resp. risk increases) the running time of TRAM decreases.
  Our extensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the existence and practical
  utility of such tradeoffs, not only for k-means but also for Gaussian Mixture Models.
