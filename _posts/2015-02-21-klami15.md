title: "{Latent feature regression for multivariate count data}"
abstract: We consider the problem of regression on multivariate count data and present  a
  Gibbs sampler for a latent feature regression model suitable for both under- and
  overdispersed response variables.  The model learns count-valued latent features
  conditional on arbitrary covariates, modeling them as negative binomial variables,
  and maps them into the dependent count-valued observations using a Dirichlet-multinomial
  distribution. From another viewpoint, the model can be seen as a generalization
  of a specific topic model for scenarios where we are interested in generating the
  actual counts of observations and not just their relative frequencies and co-occurrences.
  The model is demonstrated on a smart traffic application where the task is to predict
  public transportation volume for unknown locations based on a characterization of
  the close-by services and venues.
