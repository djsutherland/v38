title: Learning Deep Sigmoid Belief Networks with Data Augmentation
abstract: 'Deep directed generative models are developed. The multi-layered model
  is designed by stacking sigmoid belief networks, with sparsity-encouraging priors
  placed on the model parameters. Learning and inference of layer-wise model parameters
  are implemented in a Bayesian setting. By exploring the idea of data augmentation
  and introducing auxiliary Polya-Gamma variables, simple and efficient Gibbs sampling
  and mean-field variational Bayes (VB) inference are implemented. To address large-scale
  datasets, an online version of VB is also developed. Experimental results are presented
  for three publicly available datasets: MNIST, Caltech 101 Silhouettes and OCR letters.'
