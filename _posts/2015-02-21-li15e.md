title: Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Multi-label Learning with Incomplete
  Labels
abstract: Standard multi-label learning methods assume fully labeled training data.
  This assumption however is impractical in many application domains where labels
  are difficult to collect and missing labels are prevalent. In this paper, we develop
  a novel conditional restricted Boltzmann machine model to address multi-label learning
  with incomplete labels. It uses a restricted Boltzmann machine to capture the high-order
  label dependence relationships in the output space, aiming to enhance the capacity
  of recovering missing labels and learning high quality multi-label prediction models.
  Moreover, it also incorporates label co-occurrence information retrieved from auxiliary
  resources as prior knowledge. We perform model training by maximizing the regularized
  marginal conditional likelihood of the label vectors given the input features, and
  develop a Viterbi style EM algorithm to solve the induced optimization problem.
  The proposed approach is evaluated on four real word multi-label data sets by comparing
  to a number of state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show it outperforms
  all the other comparison methods across the applied data sets.
