title: Metric recovery from directed unweighted graphs
abstract: We analyze directed, unweighted graphs obtained from x_i∈\RR^d by connecting
  vertex i to j iff |x_i - x_j| < ε(x_i). Examples of such graphs include k-nearest
  neighbor graphs, where ε(x_i) varies from point to point, and, arguably, many real
  world graphs such as co-purchasing graphs. We ask whether we can recover the underlying
  Euclidean metric ε(x_i) and the associated density p(x_i) given only the directed
  graph and d.   We show that consistent recovery is possible up to isometric scaling
  when the vertex degree is at least ω(n^2/(2+d)\log(n)^d/(d+2)). Our estimator is
  based on a careful characterization of a random walk over the directed graph and
  the associated continuum limit. As an algorithm, it resembles the PageRank centrality
  metric. We demonstrate empirically that the estimator performs well on simulated
  examples as well as on real-world co-purchasing graphs even with a small number
  of points and degree scaling as low as \log(n).
