title: Predictive Inverse Optimal Control for Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Systems
abstract: Predictive inverse optimal control is a powerful approach for estimating
  the control policy of an agent from observed control demonstrations. Its usefulness
  has been established in a number of large-scale sequential decision settings characterized
  by complete state observability. However, many real decisions are made in situations
  where the state is not fully known to the agent making decisions. Though extensions
  of predictive inverse optimal control to partially observable Markov decision processes
  have been developed, their applicability has been limited by the complexities of
  inference in those representations. In this work, we extend predictive inverse optimal
  control to the linear- quadratic-Gaussian control setting. We establish close connections
  between optimal control laws for this setting and the probabilistic predictions
  under our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit in estimating control
  policies that are influenced by partial observability on both synthetic and real
  datasets.
