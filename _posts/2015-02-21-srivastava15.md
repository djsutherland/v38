title: "{WASP: Scalable Bayes via barycenters of subset posteriors}"
abstract: The promise of Bayesian methods for big data sets has not fully been realized
  due to the lack of scalable computational algorithms. For massive data, it is necessary
  to store and process subsets on different machines in a distributed manner. We propose
  a simple, general, and highly efficient approach, which first runs a posterior sampling
  algorithm in parallel on different machines for subsets of a large data set. To
  combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly
  efficient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP)
  has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries
  of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms
  for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data. We provide theoretical
  justification in terms of posterior consistency and algorithm efficiency.  Examples
  are provided in complex settings including Gaussian process regression and nonparametric
  Bayes mixture models.
