title: "{Multi-Manifold Modeling in Non-Euclidean spaces}"
abstract: This paper advocates a novel framework for segmenting a dataset on a Riemannian
  manifold M into clusters lying around low-dimensional submanifolds of M. Important
  examples of M, for which the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, include
  the sphere, the set of positive definite matrices, and the Grassmannian. The proposed
  algorithm constructs a data-affinity matrix by thoroughly exploiting the intrinsic
  geometry and then applies spectral clustering. Local geometry is encoded by sparse
  coding and directional information of local tangent spaces and geodesics, which
  is important in resolving intersecting clusters and establishing the theoretical
  guarantees for a simplified variant of the algorithm. To avoid complication, these
  guarantees assume that the underlying submanifolds are geodesic.  Extensive validation
  on synthetic and real data demonstrates the resiliency of the proposed method against
  deviations from the theoretical (geodesic) model as well as its superior performance
  over state-of-the-art techniques.
