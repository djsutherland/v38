title: A Bayes consistent 1-NN classifier
abstract: We show that a simple modification of the 1-nearest neighbor classifier
  yields a strongly Bayes consistent learner. Prior to this work, the only strongly
  Bayes consistent proximity-based method was the k-nearest neighbor classifier, for
  k growing appropriately with sample size. We will argue that a margin-regularized
  1-NN enjoys considerable statistical and algorithmic advantages over the k-NN classifier.
  These include user-friendly finite-sample error bounds, as well as time- and memory-efficient
  learning and test-point evaluation algorithms with a principled speed-accuracy tradeoff.
  Encouraging empirical results are reported.
