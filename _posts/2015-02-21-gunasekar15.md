title: Consistent Collective Matrix Completion under Joint Low Rank Structure
abstract: We address the collective matrix completion problem of jointly recovering
  a  collection of matrices with shared structure from partial (and potentially noisy)
  observations. To ensure well–posedness of the problem, we impose a joint low rank
  structure, wherein each component matrix is low rank and the latent space of the
  low rank factors corresponding to each entity is shared across the entire collection.
  We first develop a rigorous algebra for representing and manipulating collective–matrix
  structure, and identify sufficient conditions for consistent estimation of collective
  matrices. We then propose a tractable convex estimator for solving the collective
  matrix completion problem, and provide the first non–trivial theoretical guarantees  for
  consistency of collective matrix completion. We show that under reasonable assumptions
  stated in Sec. 3.1, with high probability, the proposed estimator exactly recovers
  the true matrices whenever sample complexity requirements dictated by Theorem 1
  are met. The sample complexity requirement derived in the paper are optimum up to
  logarithmic factors, and significantly improve upon the requirements obtained by
  trivial extensions of standard matrix completion. Finally, we propose a scalable
  approximate algorithm to solve the proposed convex program, and  corroborate our
  results through simulated and real life experiments.
