title: A Consistent Method for Graph Based Anomaly Localization
abstract: The anomaly localization task aims at detecting faulty sensors automatically
  by monitoring the sensor values. In this paper, we propose an anomaly localization
  algorithm with a consistency guarantee on its results. Although several algorithms
  were proposed in the last decade, the consistency of the localization results was
  not discussed in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  study that provides theoretical guarantees for the localization results. Our new
  approach is to formulate the task as solving the sparsest subgraph problem on a
  difference graph. Since this problem is NP-hard, we then use a convex quadratic
  programming approximation algorithm, which is guaranteed to be consistent under
  suitable conditions. Across the simulations on both synthetic and real world datasets,
  we verify that the proposed method achieves higher anomaly localization performance
  compared to existing methods.
