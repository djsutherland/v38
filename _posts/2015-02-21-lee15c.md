title: 'Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering with Exponential Family:  Small-Variance
  Asymptotics and Reducibility'
abstract: Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) is an agglomerative clustering method,
  where a probabilistic model is defined and its marginal likelihoods are evaluated
  to decide which clusters to merge. While BHC provides a few advantages over traditional
  distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms, successive evaluation of marginal
  likelihoods and careful hyperparameter tuning are cumbersome and limit the scalability.
  In this paper we relax BHC into a non-probabilistic formulation, exploring smallvariance
  asymptotics in conjugate-exponential models. We develop a novel clustering algorithm,
  referred to as relaxed BHC (RBHC), from the asymptotic limit of the BHC model that
  exhibits the scalability of distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms as
  well as the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We also investigate the
  reducibility of the dissimilarity measure emerged from the asymptotic limit of the
  BHC model, allowing us to use scalable algorithms such as the nearest neighbor chain
  algorithm. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  the validity and high performance of our method.
