title: "{Sparse Submodular Probabilistic PCA}"
abstract: We propose a novel approach for sparse probabilistic principal component
  analysis, that combines a low rank representation for the latent factors and loadings
  with a novel sparse variational inference approach for estimating distributions
  of latent variables subject to sparse support constraints. Inference and parameter
  estimation for the resulting model is achieved via expectation maximization with
  a novel variational inference method for the E-step that induces sparsity. We show
  that this inference problem can be reduced to discrete optimal support selection.
  The discrete optimization is submodular, hence, greedy selection is guaranteed to
  achieve 1-1/e fraction of the optimal. Empirical studies indicate effectiveness
  of the proposed approach for the recovery of a parsimonious decomposition as compared
  to established baseline methods. We also evaluate our method against state-of-the-art
  methods on high dimensional fMRI data, and show that the method performs as good
  as or better than other methods.
