title: Stochastic Block Transition Models for Dynamic Networks
abstract: There has been great interest in recent years on statistical models for
  dynamic networks. In this paper, I propose a stochastic block transition model (SBTM)
  for dynamic networks that is inspired by the well-known stochastic block model (SBM)
  for static networks and previous dynamic extensions of the SBM. Unlike most existing
  dynamic network models, it does not make a hidden Markov assumption on the edge-level
  dynamics, allowing the presence or absence of edges to directly influence future
  edge probabilities while retaining the interpretability of the SBM. I derive an
  approximate inference procedure for the SBTM and demonstrate that it is significantly
  better at reproducing durations of edges in real social network data.
