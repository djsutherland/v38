title: Generalized Linear Models for Aggregated Data
abstract: Databases in domains such as healthcare are routinely released to the public
  in aggregated form. Unfortunately, naive modeling with aggregated data may significantly
  diminish the accuracy of inferences at the individual level. This paper addresses
  the scenario where features are provided at the individual level, but the target
  variables are only available as histogram aggregates or order statistics. We consider
  a limiting case of generalized linear modeling when the target variables are only
  known up to permutation, and explore how this relates to permutation testing; a
  standard technique for assessing statistical dependency. Based on this relationship,
  we propose a simple algorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level
  inferences via alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting.
  Our results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in the original
  data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of the linear relationship.
  The framework is extended to general histogram data with larger bins - with order
  statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Our experimental results on simulated
  data and aggregated healthcare data suggest a diminishing returns property with
  respect to the granularity of the histogram - when a linear relationship holds in
  the original data, the targets can be predicted accurately given relatively coarse
  histograms.
