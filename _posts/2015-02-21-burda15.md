title: "{Accurate and conservative estimates of MRF log-likelihood using reverse annealing}"
abstract: Markov random fields (MRFs) are difficult to evaluate as generative models
  because computing the test log-probabilities requires the intractable partition
  function. Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is widely used to estimate MRF partition
  functions, and often yields quite accurate results. However, AIS is prone to overestimate
  the log-likelihood with little indication that anything is wrong. We present the
  Reverse AIS Estimator (RAISE), a stochastic lower bound on the log-likelihood of
  an approximation to the original MRF model. RAISE requires only the same MCMC transition
  operators as standard AIS. Experimental results indicate that RAISE agrees closely
  with AIS log-probability estimates for RBMs, DBMs, and DBNs, but typically errs
  on the side of underestimating, rather than overestimating, the log-likelihood.
