title: Implementable confidence sets in high dimensional regression
abstract: We consider the setting of linear regression in high dimension. We focus
  on the problem of constructing adaptive and honest confidence sets for the sparse
  parameter θ, i.e. we want to construct a confidence set for theta that contains
  theta with high probability, and that is as small as possible. The l_2 diameter
  of a such confidence set should depend on the sparsity S of θ- the larger S, the
  wider the confidence set. However, in practice, S is unknown. This paper focuses
  on constructing a confidence set for θwhich contains θwith high probability, whose
  diameter is adaptive to the unknown sparsity S, and which is implementable in practice.
