title: Column Subset Selection with Missing Data via Active Sampling
abstract: Column subset selection of massive data matrices has found numerous applications
  in real-world data systems. In this paper, we propose and analyze two sampling based
  algorithms for column subset selection without access to the complete input matrix.
  To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for column subset selection with
  missing data that are provably correct. The proposed methods work for row/column
  coherent matrices by employing the idea of adaptive sampling. Furthermore, when
  the input matrix has a noisy low-rank structure, one algorithm enjoys a relative
  error bound.
