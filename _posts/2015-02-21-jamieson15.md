title: Sparse Dueling Bandits
abstract: The dueling bandit problem is a variation of the classical multi-armed bandit
  in which the allowable actions are noisy comparisons between pairs of arms. This
  paper focuses on a new approach for finding the best arm according to the Borda
  criterion using noisy comparisons. We prove that in the absence of structural assumptions,
  the sample complexity of this problem is proportional to the sum of the inverse
  gaps squared of the Borda scores of each arm. We explore this dependence further
  and consider structural constraints on the pairwise comparison matrix (a particular
  form of sparsity natural to this problem) that can significantly reduce the sample
  complexity. This motivates a new algorithm called Successive Elimination with Comparison
  Sparsity (SECS) that exploits sparsity to find the Borda winner using fewer samples
  than standard algorithms. We also evaluate the new algorithm experimentally with
  synthetic and real data. The results show that the sparsity model and the new algorithm
  can provide significant improvements over standard approaches.
