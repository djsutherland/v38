title: Cross-domain recommendation without shared users or items by sharing latent
  vector distributions
abstract: We propose a cross-domain recommendation method for predicting the ratings
  of items in different domains, where neither users nor items are shared across domains.
  The proposed method is based on matrix factorization, which learns a latent vector
  for each user and each item. Matrix factorization techniques for a single-domain
  fail in the cross-domain recommendation task because the learned latent vectors
  are not aligned over different domains. The proposed method assumes that latent
  vectors in different domains are generated from a common Gaussian distribution with
  a full covariance matrix. By inferring the mean and covariance of the common Gaussian
  from given cross-domain rating matrices, the latent factors are aligned, which enables
  us to predict ratings in different domains. Experiments conducted on rating datasets
  from a wide variety of domains, e.g., movie, books and electronics, demonstrate
  that the proposed method achieves higher performance for predicting cross-domain
  ratings than existing methods.
