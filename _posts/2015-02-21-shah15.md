title: 'Estimation from Pairwise Comparisons: Sharp Minimax Bounds with Topology Dependence'
abstract: Consider the problem of identifying the underlying qualities of a set of
  items based on measuring noisy comparisons between pairs of items. The Bradley-Terry-Luce
  (BTL) and Thurstone models are the most widely used parametric models for such pairwise
  comparison data. Working within a standard minimax framework, this paper provides
  sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error in estimating the underlying qualities
  under the BTL and the Thurstone models. These bounds are are topology-aware, meaning
  that they change qualitatively depending on the comparison graph induced by the
  subset of pairs being compared. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may
  be chosen, our results provide some principled guidelines for making this choice.
  Finally, we compare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement models
  and show that the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal settings have identical
  scalings apart from constant pre-factors. We use this result to investigate the
  relative merits of cardinal and ordinal measurement schemes.
